                <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <div class="half-width">
                   <p> I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into
                        tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was
                        fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how
                        to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
                </div>
                  <div class="half-width">
                    <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first
                        website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking
                        for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my
                        organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

                    <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content
                        is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                    <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean
                        and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                    <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                    <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &amp; accurately convert it into a webpage
                        that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
